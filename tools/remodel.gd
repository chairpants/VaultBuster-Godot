## The back of the building reworked, a section at a time, on world/world.scn and data/interact.json in place (git has
## what they were):
##     godot --headless --path . -s tools/remodel.gd -- <section>
##     godot --headless --path . -s tools/remodel.gd -- check    (the data file written back unchanged: the writer's test)
## Each one first keeps the level and its data as they were, in user://remodel/ (dated, by section).
## From JellyVault's (its cinema-night), run here in the order it ran there: seating, doorway, boh, theater, restroom,
## railings, hall, roof, closet, stairwell, breakroom, aisles, lavatory, booth, outside, foyer, auditorium, lounge, front,
## touchups, escutcheons, lettering, punchlist, dropbox, swap, ficus, pot, rug, couch, backroof, drain, fixes, nav.
##
## seating (VaultBuster's, first): the theater's rows as JellyVault had them before the rest: one block in the middle,
##   the aisles down both sides, a collider behind each row's seat backs (what the theater section builds on). Taken
##   whole from JellyVault's level, its theater node, as it was then (git show 9205dea^:world/world.scn):
##       godot --headless --path . -s tools/remodel.gd -- seating /path/to/that.scn
## doorway (VaultBuster's): the back wall's shelf unit where the hall's new way in goes (boh moves it there: JellyVault
##   had no shelves to move), out of the level, and its tapes out of data/tapes.json (a save's are kept by key: gone,
##   they're skipped). The locked sections' copies of them in world/extras.glb: main.gd cuts the same unit out of those
##
## boh: the janitor's closet in off its bump, inside the building's line, at the end of a shorter hall; the hall's way
##   in from the store moved along the back wall toward the middle; the restroom and break room 2 m deeper, the
##   wall between them and the restroom's door moved over to fit. The lobby goes 2 m deeper with them (room for the
##   booth's stairs, later), and the theater back the same.
## theater: the auditorium as wide as the lobby, flush with the store's side wall, a seat more each end of every row;
##   its ceiling up from 3.6 m to 6, the screen and its curtains a fifth bigger, its back wall its own colour all the way
##   down. Over the lobby's back, a projection booth (floor 3 m, ceiling 6; staff only, so grey, on its own light
##   switch), a window in it to watch from and a spinning stool at it; up a walled-in stairwell in the lobby's corner,
##   round a landing, through a door marked for staff; the beam from its port. Outside, the booth and the auditorium
##   one taller block, roofed at 6.4 m, with an iron stair up to it
##   from the store's roof; the back ladder moved off its side to the back of the back of house.
## railings: a black iron railing on the step behind each pair of the front row's wheelchair spaces, for the row behind
##   (posts, a mid rail, a round top rail; solid as everything is, main.gd)
## hall: the back hall less bare. A rubber base along its walls; the break room's and the restroom's doors panelled, kick
##   plates both sides, hinges; the ceiling lights framed; an extinguisher on its bracket and its sign; a lit EXIT over the
##   way back to the store; the staff's corkboard between the doors, notices pinned to it
## roof: the store's roof less bare. On the tall block's wall over it: the booth's exhaust louvre, two scuppers off its roof
##   and their downspouts to splash blocks, a wall pack, a disconnect and its conduit; a satellite dish on a ballasted
##   mount; next door's rooftop unit, a plain box, given its louvres, its fan, its rails and its disconnect
## closet: the janitor's closet's mop bucket (a box of boxes) a rolling one, its tub oval and yellow, dirty water in it,
##   the wringer on its end and the press's lever up, on casters; the safety sheets' station on the wall by the shelves
## stairwell: the stairs up to the booth less bare: its walls block, coursed and pointed (laid over them, clear of the door
##   and the way out); the rails on brackets; a grip strip on every tread; BOOTH and the way, stencilled on the landing's wall
## breakroom: the tall block's base course out of the break room (it ran on along the block's side, through the wall,
##   where the back rooms meet it: a grey kerb along the room's west wall); the table's top banded in chrome; a microwave on
##   its cart in the corner by the west wall, its door, window, keypad and handle, plates and a roll of towels under it
## aisles: the hanging TVs over the sales floor (a box, a smaller box behind, a screen) made CRTs: the tube's housing
##   tapering back to a neck, a bezel round the picture with its badge and a power light, vents in the top, a mounting
##   plate behind; and the ceiling given its sprinkler heads, a grid of them clear of the light panels
## lavatory: the restroom furnished as one is: grab bars by the toilet, a baby-changing station folded up on the bare
##   east wall, a floor drain, an exhaust fan's grille in the ceiling
## booth: the booth's machines less blocky. The projector's head given its side door and knobs, the gate's rollers
##   and the film's loop down through it, a lens turret; a motor under it, its console's switch panel and hour meter.
##   The lamp house a door, its handle and the sight glass showing the arc, a maker's plate. The platters lipped, the
##   brain's payout rollers. The sound rack's rails and screws, its units' VU meters and knobs
## outside: the store's bare east side and the theater's back given what's on the back of a building: on the side, the
##   electric meters and their disconnect with the conduit up to the roof, the gas meter on its riser, a hose bib, wall
##   packs; the dumpster on a concrete pad behind two bollards. On the theater's back, its emergency exit (a steel door
##   in its frame, no handle this side, a stoop under it, a lit EXIT over it, a wall pack), a louvre up high
## foyer: the theater's lobby as a cinema's: wainscot below a gold chair rail round its bare walls, deco sconces either
##   side of the way in, a padded bench between them; the concession counter (a plain box) a front of raised panels and a
##   gold band, its top overhanging; a popcorn machine on it, a soda fountain beside its candy case
## auditorium: the auditorium's black void over its wall panels filled: a gold cap rail along the panels' tops, the
##   surround speakers up the side walls (cabinets angled down, their grilles), and a ceiling of pin lights, one mesh
## lounge: the preview corner furnished round its TV: a speaker either side on its stand, a potted fig in the corner,
##   tapes stacked on the coffee table and the remote by them
## front: the way in: a ribbed entry mat inside the doors, its border the store's blue and yellow; on the glass either
##   side of them, vinyl lettering to the street (NEW RELEASES EVERY TUESDAY, the hours, the drop box round the side)
## touchups: after a look round. The entry mat's ribs (thin boxes, shimmering and uneven from a distance) a texture with
##   its smaller copies; the sprinklers fewer (a 6 m grid) and made as pendent heads (a yoke, the red bulb, the deflector);
##   the lounge's fig a ficus (braided trunks, branches, a crown of small leaves) not a heap of balls; in the break room,
##   the counter's run slid along to stop at the fridge (it ran into it) and the level's own microwave, inside the fridge, out
## escutcheons: the sprinklers down to the tiles (they were 5 cm up inside the ceiling: the data's height for it, not the
##   tiles'), each plate (a flat white disc) a chrome recessed escutcheon: a rolled rim, the cup inside it, a collar
## lettering: the window lettering each on a pane of its own, centred between its mullions and small enough to fit it
## punchlist: the old OPEN 10A-12A DAILY sign inside the window out; a curbside return box by the doors (the window's
##   lettering pointed at a drop box there wasn't), the lettering saying so; the stairwell's blockwork one pattern over
##   every wall (each wall's picture was laid from its own corner: on the booth's side, two pieces met half a course out);
##   the theater's emergency exit (it was on the back of the building, behind the screen) on its right-hand wall, over the
##   level floor at the back, a panel shortened for it, a landing where the aisle starts down: a panic bar and a lit EXIT
##   inside, outside a flat door with nothing to open it by; the cardboard bed out back moved clear of the auditorium (it
##   would be inside it, widened: JellyVault took it out; here it's slept on); in the janitor's closet the
##   trash chute's hopper onto the wall nearest the dumpster (the safety sheets over it, the carpet sweeper along to make
##   room), its outlet through the wall, and the dumpster up against the wall under it (its pad and bollards with it, the
##   electric meters along out of its way)
## dropbox: the return box's lettering sized to the box (it ran past both its sides)
## swap: the restroom and the break room change places: the restroom west, the first door off the hall from the store
##   (the customers' way in), the break room east; the wall between them 2 m west (the restroom 3.6 m across, the break
##   room 5), each room's things along with it to its new walls, its floor, tiles and base fitted to it, the door signs
##   swapped, the light switches by their doors
## ficus: the fig's leaves less alike: each where it was, but every one turned anew: pointing out from the trunk give or
##   take, some hanging nearly straight down, some tipped up, most between, rolled about the midrib, twisted a little in
##   their own plane (they lay level, all one way round, as if on a table: the touch-ups flattened each ball along the
##   world's axes after turning it, so none of its turns showed)
## pot: the fig's pot V2: a turned terracotta pot, not a plain tapered cylinder: a foot, its body flaring up to a rolled rim
##   band and lip, hollow (its inner wall down to the soil, set in below the rim); mottled, a pale mineral bloom under the
##   band, darker where the water's soaked at its foot; lumpy soil with a few pebbles; a saucer under it
## rug: the lounge's rug (the hotel's hexagons) given a thickness: on the floor, 1.6 cm up to its face (it lay 1 cm up and
##   paper thin), a bound edge round it, rounded over at the top; and what stands on it up half that (0.8 cm), as into
##   its pile: the couch, the coffee table and what's on it, the TV, the lamps and their pools of light, the speakers, the fig
## couch: the lounge couch's middle back cushion (the tall, arched one) and the piping along its top wider, out to tuck in
##   under the side ones' edges: the level had a 2.6 cm slot either side of it, only a black seam strip set back in it
## drain: the tall roof's west scupper, collector head, downspout and splash block off the foot of the iron stair, to the
##   block's far end, past the stair's landing (x -7.2): its splash block was the stair's first step, its downspout down
##   inside its width, and its collector head over the bottom tread, in the way of your head from the first step up (so
##   no one got past it). Not just along the wall: anywhere this side of the stair, its splash block's in the way to it
## backroof: what the back ladder's move and the swap got wrong, put right. The back ladder's sliding half is the one
##   that hangs latched up at y 2 (out/group of 1112), not its fixed top with the hoops (between_rooms/group of 20): boh
##   marked the top, which fixtures.gd found already down, so kicked loose the ladder never fell and was climbed all the
##   same. And two of the data's points the swap's moves took for the rooms': the lobby's light box's east side (2.05,
##   on the edge of what went 3.8 m east: the booth's light, which the box carries up to the tall block's ceiling, on
##   the store's roof by it) and where the back ladder sets you on the roof (over the break room: 3.2 m off the ladder)
## restroom: the floors either side of the wall between the restroom and the break room meeting under it, square (boh
##   moved that wall over, but only the floors' far corners with it: a wedge of the break room's floor in the restroom).
## fixes (VaultBuster's): what JellyVault's level has that its sections don't make: the stairwell's wall by the back
##   of house up the whole height of the stairs, the booth's beside it meeting it; one bin's spot. And the break room's
##   chair across the table back at it (boh's line ran between them: JellyVault's nobody sits on).
## nav (VaultBuster's, last): people's floor boxes for the back of the building worked out again from the level, as it
##   is now (JellyVault's people don't walk about: its sections only moved the old ones along).
##
## Things are moved the way level.gd moves them past SEAM: a small thing whole, by where its middle is; anything big
## that crosses the edge of what's moving is stretched, its far vertices moved and its texture carried on rather
## than pulled long. What's in data/interact.json goes the same way, by the same regions.
